# Introduction
Google stores the vast majority of its code in one monolithic codebase, holding
billions of lines of code. As of 2016, more than 25,000 software engineers wer
e contributing to it, improving existing services and adding cool new features
to meet the demands of their users.
With the growing size of the codebase and the increasing number of Google
software engineers, it is getting challenging to schedule the engineers' work,
so they can be productive and launch features that make users happy.
